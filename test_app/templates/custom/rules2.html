            <b>2. Learning Phase</b>
            <br>During your learning phase, you may play any of the cards in your hand to make Wisdom. Ignore their normal costs and effects.
            <br>Each card generates Wisdom equal to its Wisdom value (on the left, in a dark box), if it has one.  Otherwise it makes none.
            <br>You may learn any card from the supply by paying its Wisdom cost. Put newly learned cards in a separate pile to your discarded cards.
        </p>
        <p>
            After you're done making Wisdom and learning things, discard your played cards and go to the end phase.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. End Phase</b>
            <br>If the supply has fewer than seven cards in it, add new ones from the supply deck until it's back to seven.
            <br>Optionally, you may 'prepare' one card from your hand by putting it back on top of your deck.
            <br>Discard the rest of your hand. Draw five new cards from your deck.
        </p>
        <p>
            If at any point you try to draw from an empty deck, shuffle your discard pile and learned pile together and turn them over to form a new deck.
            Before doing this, for each card in your learning pile, <i>trash</i> a card from your discard pile. Set it aside; it's no longer in your deck.
